          <h4>Welcome to GalaSpot!</h4>

          <p>We assume you are here because you want to plan an event, maybe it’s your dream wedding, your first child’s first birthday, you parents 25th anniversary or any other event under the moon.</p>
          <p>Great, you have a achieved or hit a very significant milestone in your life and you want to celebrate it with loved ones. You want an amazing party, great photos, delicious food, really fashionable but also very classy clothes and you want your
            guests to talk about your event for years to come.</p>
          <p>You think about the event, the people you will invite, how many days you will take off work and this get’s you all excited. Amazing, you immediately start thinking of how to make this happen and realize that you have no clue as to where to start?
            You think on it for a while, do a quick google search and the chaos of options confuse you. You are tired of searching through the options and get de-moralized.</p>
          <p>How do we know this is going to happen, it happened to us when a friend of ours wanted to plan her wedding. All you know is there is some uncle who know’s a lot about function halls, an aunt who could get you in touch with the best makeup artists,
            your friend's uncle’s neighbor who is an absolutely fantastic caterer, your brother's friend who really wants to be a photographer. How do you co-ordinate with all these people and plan an event that you really want? How do you know they are
            as good? With work, family duties, sticking to your goal of going to the gym 3 times a week, getting more sleep and the gazillion other things going on in your life, planning an event can be extremely tough and a hugely anxiety inducing task.</p>
          <p>We went through this hell multiple times which led to the idea of GalaSpot. With no stress to you, you can plan a mock event at GalaSpot where we will give information on all things events like</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The venue location, price, seating capacity, availablitily.</li>
            <li>Different catering options, their availabiltiy, pricing. etc.</li>
            <li>The different caterers available, how to contact them, what their prices, recent events that they did and reviews on their food.</li>
            <li>The various photographers and videographers that are available near the venue you choose, their price points, their portfolios</li>
            <li>What are the hot looks this season, pictures of clothes and information on where to get them</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All this and many more services that will make your planning an event as easy as going to someone else's function. We envision a future where GalaSpot would be your one stop shop for all things events.</p>
